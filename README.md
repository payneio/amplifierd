# Amplifier Education

This is a repo where I figure out what this amplifier thing is.

I started by using amplifier.v1 to create a set of documents about itself and put them in the [`guides`](./guides/README.md) folder.

Then I had amplifier create a set of notebooks that demonstrate how to use amplifier-core in the [`notebooks/amplifier-core`](./notebooks/amplifier-core/README.md) folder.

Then, I had amplifier create a web-server (daemon) to work with the amplifier-core packages in the [`amplifierd`](./amplifierd/README.md) folder, and a set of notebooks that demonstrate how to use that server in the [`notebooks/amplifierd`](./notebooks/amplifierd/README.md) folder. Run the daemon and then open the notebooks to see how to interact with it.

To get a better handle on amplifier@next (v2), feel free to explore the guides and notebooks.
